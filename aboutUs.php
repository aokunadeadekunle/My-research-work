   Despite the fact that Internet has led to creation of digital globalization; traditional IP networks are complex and very hard to manage especially in the area of network configuration, according to the predefined policies and to reconfigure it to response to fault(s), load and change(s). The basic concept of software defined network (SDN) is to separates the networkâ€™s control (brains) and forwarding (muscle) planes to make it easier to optimize. The most common protocol used in SDN networks to facilitate the communication between the Controller and switches is currently OpenFlow (OF); this is an example of Southbound Application Progamme Interface (API) of SDN. There are some other examples of API protocols such as Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES), SoftRouter architecture, Path Computation Element (PCE), Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) and so on. OpenFlow is an open standard of a communication protocol that enables the control plane to interact with the forwarding plane. People often point to OpenFlow as being synonymous with SDN, but it is only a single element in the overall SDN architecture.
